# Historical ExecPlans (Non-Canonical)

This folder archives legacy ExecPlans that predate the current canonical plan in `PLANS.md`.
They are preserved for traceability only and **must not** be treated as sources of truth.

For current execution guidance, use:
- `PLANS.md`
- `SYSTEM_SPEC.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
