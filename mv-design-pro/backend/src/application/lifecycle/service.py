P10a Lifecycle Service — Result Invalidation and Snapshot Binding

CANONICAL ALIGNMENT:
- Project → StudyCase → Run → Snapshot lifecycle management
- Result invalidation when network model changes (new snapshot)
- Deterministic fingerprint-based change detection

INVARIANTS:
- When snapshot changes, ALL cases bound to old snapshot become OUTDATED
- When snapshot changes, ALL runs bound to old snapshot become OUTDATED
- Project.active_network_snapshot_id is updated atomically with invalidation
