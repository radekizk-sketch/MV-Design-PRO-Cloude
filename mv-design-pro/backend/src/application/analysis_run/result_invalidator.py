Result Invalidator — PR-4: Study Case Lifecycle & Result Invalidation

Cascading invalidation for project-wide and case-level changes.

INVALIDATION MATRIX (§10.8, BINDING):
| Event                        | Scope       | New Status |
|------------------------------|-------------|------------|
| Model changed (new snapshot) | ALL cases   | OUTDATED   |
| Config changed               | Single case | OUTDATED   |
| Protection config changed    | Single case | OUTDATED   |
| Wizard commit (ENM edit)     | ALL cases   | OUTDATED   |
